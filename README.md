# Tower Defense / C++

Tower Defense is a 6-week game project featuring a GUI, which was programmed with Qt. The project was conducted with three other students as a part of C++ programming course. Git was used for version control, but this isn't the initial repository.

The folder includes only the source/header files of which I was in charge of. No PNG/MP3 files included.
